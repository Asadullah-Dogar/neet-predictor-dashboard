```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "f:\NEET Predictor"

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Move data file
Move-Item LFS2020-21.dta data\raw\
```

### Step 2: Verify Everything Works (5 minutes)

```powershell

#### Option B: Run Python Scripts (Faster for testing)
```python
# In Python console or new script:
exec(open('src/data_preprocessing.py').read())  # Test module
# Manually create df_youth and save
```

### Step 4: Generate CEO One-Pager (30 minutes)

Use the template in `NOTEBOOK_TEMPLATES.md`:
1. Fill in actual numbers from your notebooks
2. Take screenshot of best district map
3. Export to PDF (use Word/PowerPoint or pandoc)
4. Save as `reports/CEO_onepager.pdf`

### Step 5: Launch Dashboard (5 minutes)

```powershell
streamlit run streamlit_app\app.py

## 🎓 What Each Module Does

### `src/data_preprocessing.py`
**What it does:**

- Creates NEET label with clear logic
- Removes PII (names, addresses, phone numbers)
- Cleans and standardizes variables
- Creates interaction features

**Key functions:**
- `load_raw(path)` → Loads .dta file

## 💡 Pro Tips for Success

### 1. Start with Small Sample
When developing notebooks, work with a small sample first:
```python
df_sample = df.sample(1000, random_state=42)
# Test your code on df_sample first
```

### 2. Check Data Types
Stata files can be tricky with categorical variables:
```python
print(df.dtypes)  # Check data types
print(df['sex'].unique())  # Check unique values
```

### 3. Handle Missing Values
Be explicit about how you handle missing data:
```python
# Conservative approach for NEET labeling
df['in_education'] = df['education_status'].fillna('No') == 'Yes'
```

### 4. Use Survey Weights
If your LFS data has survey weights, apply them:
```python
# In modeling
model.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=sample_weight)

# In reporting
weighted_neet_rate = np.average(df['NEET'], weights=df['weight'])
```

### 5. Validate Predictions
Sanity check your model:
```python
# Do high-risk areas match your domain knowledge?
print(df.groupby('province')['neet_prob'].mean())
```

### 6. Save Intermediate Outputs
Don't lose work if something crashes:
```python
# After each major step
df.to_csv('data/processed/checkpoint_01.csv', index=False)
```

### 7. Document Assumptions
Add markdown cells explaining your choices:
```markdown
## Assumptions
- NEET = not in education AND not employed AND not in training
- Age range: 15-24 years
- Missing education status assumed as "not in education"
```

## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: "Can't find module 'src'"
```python
# Add this at top of every notebook:
import sys
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, str(Path.cwd().parent / 'src'))
```

### Issue 2: "File not found: LFS2020-21.dta"
```powershell
# Move file to correct location:
Move-Item LFS2020-21.dta "data\raw\"

# Verify it's there:
Get-ChildItem "data\raw\"
```

### Issue 3: Memory error with large dataset
```python
# Load in chunks:
chunks = []
for chunk in pd.read_stata('data/raw/LFS2020-21.dta', chunksize=10000):
    # Filter to youth only
    chunk_youth = chunk[(chunk['age'] >= 15) & (chunk['age'] <= 24)]
    chunks.append(chunk_youth)
df = pd.concat(chunks, ignore_index=True)
```

### Issue 4: SHAP computation too slow
```python
# Use smaller sample:
shap_data = compute_shap_values(
    model, 
    X_test[:50],  # Only 50 samples
    feature_names, 
    sample_size=50
)
```

### Issue 5: Variable names don't match
```python
# Manually specify variable mapping:
var_map = {
    'age': 'AGE',  # Your actual column name
    'sex': 'GENDER',
    'education_status': 'SCH_ENROL',
    # etc.
}

df_youth = create_neet_label(df, var_map)
```

### Issue 6: Dashboard shows "Model not found"
```powershell
# Make sure you ran modeling notebook first
# Check if model file exists:
Get-ChildItem models\

# If missing, run notebook 03
```
